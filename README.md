# Rick And Morty App

Rick And Morty App is an app created with SwiftUI that allows you to view information about the characters from the *Rick and Morty* series. 
The app connects to a REST API to fetch data about the characters and displays it interactively.

## Features

- **Grid:** Organizes views in an orderly manner into rows and columns.
- **API REST:** The app interacts with a REST API to fetch information about characters and their series.
- **MVVM:** The MVVM design pattern is used to organize the code, separating business logic (Model), user interface representation (View), and data handling (ViewModel).
- **Combine:** Implementation of Combine to handle data reactivity.
- **Async/Await:** Usage of async/await to make API requests efficiently.
- **CoreData:** Stores character data locally to improve performance and support offline usage. It avoids unnecessary API calls by persisting fetched data on the device.
- **RootView:** Usage of states in the app to handle errors.
